For this project, you will solve five programming problems (.docx). For each problem, you should develop an algorithm presented either in pseudocode or as a flowchart, and then implement it in Java. You may want to use the online programming environment, Browxy.com to compile and execute your programs. Fix errors if there are any.

Download the Word document above and save it as U6_Project2_LastFirst.docx, for example, U6_Project2_SmithJohn.docx. 

Create and add the following under each problem: 
- An algorithm.
- A Java program.
- A screenshot of the entire screen when you execute the program on Browxy.com.
